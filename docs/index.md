# It's all about Bihar 🚩

Namaste🙏! On this website you can explore about Bihar. The culture, Festivals, Foods, History and much more.

Software Engineering of the Portal is already completed. Continuous improvement will continue to happen.
This is a community driven portal. Anyone can come and contribute via GitHub. There will be an approval system (PR Review) to ensure the authenticity and quality of the article.

We need information contributors / editors to add pages and articles there. Information type would be the details on festival / food / culture / geographical entity of Bihar.
